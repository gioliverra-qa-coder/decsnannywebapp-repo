# Project Summary
DecsNanny is a web application that connects families with trusted childcare providers, enabling parents to efficiently find, book, and manage nannies. The platform provides detailed profiles of vetted nannies, facilitating informed childcare decisions. Recent updates have enhanced the application by implementing a "Mark as Completed" functionality and clearing all test bookings to ensure a fresh start for users.

# Project Module Description
The application consists of several functional modules:
- **Landing Page**: Introduces the service and showcases featured nannies.
- **Nanny Browsing**: Users can search and filter nannies by location, experience, and hourly rate.
- **Nanny Profiles**: Detailed information about nannies, including bios, skills, availability, and reviews.
- **Booking System**: Users can schedule appointments with nannies, with real-time booking synchronization.
- **Booking Management**: Users can view and manage current and past bookings, including a "Delivered" status.
- **User Authentication**: Registration and login for both parents and nannies.
- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive profile management for nannies and parents.
- **Nanny Dashboard**: A dedicated space for nannies to manage their profiles and bookings, including delivery tracking and new "Mark as Completed" functionality.
- **My Bookings**: Allows parents to track their childcare bookings and their statuses.
